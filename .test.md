Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to launch AI Directory today!

**Why I built this:**
With the AI explosion, I found myself constantly searching for the right tools. Existing directories were either too cluttered or lacked comparison features. So I built what I wanted - a clean, fast, multilingual AI tools directory.

**What makes us different:**

- 📊 **Compare feature** - Side-by-side tool comparison (up to 4)
- 🌏 **Truly multilingual** - Not just UI, but tool descriptions in 5 languages
- 💬 **Real reviews** - User ratings you can trust
- 🚀 **Super fast** - Static site generation, instant loading
- 🔓 **Open source** - Contribute and self-host

**What's next:**

- [ ] User favorites/bookmarks
- [ ] Tool changelogs
- [ ] Weekly AI tools newsletter
- [ ] Mobile app

I'd love your feedback! What features would you like to see?

🙏 If you find it useful, an upvote would mean the world to me!
